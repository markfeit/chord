This is a description of a Share-Ware utility called CHORD.

It's purpose is to provide guitar players with a tool to produce good
looking, self-descriptive music sheet from a text file.

CHORD read a text file containing the lyrics of a song, the chords to
be played, their description and some other optional data to produce a
PostScript document that includes:

	Centered titles
	Chord names above the words
	Graphical representation of the chords at the end of the songs

CHORD also provides support for 

	Multiple logical pages per physical pages ( 1, 2 or 4)
	Configurable fonts for the lyrics and the chord names
	Multiple songs inside one file
	The complete ISO 8859-1 character set
and
	Chorus marking

===== PLATFORM =====

CHORD has been developped on SPARCStations running Solaris 2.2 and
OpenWindows 3.2. The PostScript previewer (PageView), SparcPrinters and
LaserWriter II have had no problem with the output. Please report any
changes your system requires.

===== CREDITS =====

CHORD has been developped and is still being maintained by Martin
Leclerc and Mario Dorion. 

CHORD uses the GNU getopt() routine made available to the community by
the Free Software Foundation.

We would like to thanks the following individuals:

Steve Putz, who has kindly contributed a number of suggestions, bug
fixes and enhancements(?).

Jim Gerland (GERLAND@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu), who has performed the initial
VMS port.

Leo Bicknell (ab147@freenet.acsu.buffalo.edu) has provided the chord sorting
routine.

Additional thanks to Fred handloser (and his pal Duncan) and many
others for providing many suggestions of features that were implemented
in CHORD 3.5.


===== COMPILING =====

CHORD is written in fairly portable C and should work on most UNIX
systems with little or no change. Let us know of your problems.

Simply edit the Makefile to meet your environment and 'make'.

Note: If your environment does not offer a getopt() routine edit the
Makefile to de-comment the lines (INCL, SRC and OBJ) that mention the
included getopt routine ... We reccomend using your system's getopt()
if it is available.


===== ARCHIVES =====

James B. from the University of Nevada (nevada.edu) has
graciously open the doors of their ftp site for archiving
songs in CHORD format. Look for files with the '.chordpro' 
or '.chopro' extension.
